Title: Escape Pod: Orbital Descent
You are the sole survivor of a damaged space station, launched in an escape pod spiraling toward a volatile planet. With only basic systems active and oxygen depleting, you must make split-second choices: reroute power, repair systems, navigate debris fields, and attempt contact with rescue ships. Every decision impacts whether you burn in the atmosphere, crash-land, or survive.
